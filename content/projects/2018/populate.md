This is a CLI program that can recreate a music library on a new machine by downloading
the files from various sources across the web. The program parses a file
with a hierarchical description of the library to replicate , and reproduces
that structure by consuming the sources described.
The program can also split up larger albums (via FFmpeg) into individual songs if necessary.
