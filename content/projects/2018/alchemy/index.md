**Alchemy** is a library over the API for the chat application
[Discord](http://discordapp.com/). The library integrates over Discord's REST
and Websocket APIs in order to help developers write applications for their chat
servers. *Elixir* was used in order to have easy access to the concurrency involved
in juggling these various resources.
