**Ripple** is a program implementing a small decentralised chat protocol, written in *Go*.
The protocol involves participating nodes ferrying messages to eachother in a ring like fashion.
New nodes can join the chat by talking to any of the existing nodes in the swarm. *Go* is used for
simple networking and concurrency, as well as to provide both a command line, and a graphical terminal interface.
