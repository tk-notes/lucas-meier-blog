**Haze** is a complete bittorrent client, capable of downloading any kind
of torrent found in the wild. Bittorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol, where a client
joins a large swarm of peers in order to download a file of common interest. Haskell was
used in order to help manage the concurrency involved in communicating with a large number of
peers.
