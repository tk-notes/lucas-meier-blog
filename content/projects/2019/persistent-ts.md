This is a library providing a handful of persistent data structures for Typescript.
This includes immutable collections like linked-lists, and clojure-style vectors.
Persistent data structures are immutable, but can efficiently share data between instances,
and are thus more efficient than a normal copy-on-write collection when working without mutation.
