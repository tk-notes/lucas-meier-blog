**Ginkou** is a program to build up a corpus of searchable sentences.
**Ginkou** can consume Japanese sentences from the command line, or from a text
file, parse those sentences into words, and then index those sentences for
easy retrieval. Given a word, **Ginkou** can look up sentences containing
that word, even if it's in a different form, such as a conjugated verb.
